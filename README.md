# meshtastic_bot
Make your meshtastic device smart with the power of Python!

## Overview
Useful for router_clients connected via MQTT (or other fixed devices).

This simple script leverages the power of **[Meshtastic Python](https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/python/cli)** letting users add extra actions to their stations.

* /ping Answers users, helpful to see if the station is succesfully connected to the mesh.
* /rt   Shows users RSSI and SNR of the "/rt" message recieved by the station. Useful for RangeTests.
* Telegram messages forwarding.

## TODO:
* Avoid spamming & overlap of multiple bot-stations.

## HowTo:
* Use Docker compose to run it.
  *  Clone repo, cd it, and run "docker compose up" (add -d if you want to run it in background & --build if you want to apply new changes)
* Or just install Meshtastic Python and run the Python file (need modifications).
